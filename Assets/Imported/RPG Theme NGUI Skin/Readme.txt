Thank you for purchasing my RPG Theme NGUI Skin!

This RPG Theme skin is made for the Unity3D asset plug-in NGUI: Next-Gen UI.

Requirements:
Unity 4.x
NGUI: Next-Gen UI 3.0.5 or up

Installation:

1. Make sure you have a Unity3D project running with NGUI package imported.
2. For the custom Unity3D cursor please select the cursor image in the player settings next to "Default Cursor" located @ "Edit->Project Settings->Player Settings".
3. Test the RPG Theme NGUI Skin by loading my example scene.
4. Enjoy!

ps. The current layer is set to "Default" make sure you create your own "NGUI Layer". 
Also the Health and Magic bar can be controlled in realtime with the bar script attached on them.
